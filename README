This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=957

This script was designed in order to have a simple but reliable, comprehensive and reusable set of mappings, functions and syntax in order to improve the Mailing and Posting edition. It does 'clean' the quotes in the mail (removes empty quoted lines, condense quote signs and remove signature), it changes Microsoft Outlook Express quote header to a standard quote header and put the quote where it belongs, it can remove quoted or not quoted paragraphs and it can reformat your text into a justified text inside margins.

The script has been totally rewritten for version 2.0, with a python backend written  from scratch to replace the Perl Text::Format module.

Now the main page of this script is: https://github.com/guyzmo/vim-yaposting

To install it, the script is Vundle/Pathogen ready.
         
NB: This script offers a similar, yet different way to Justify a text than : vimscript #177

Have fun!
